      "content": "Enterprises generate hundreds of thousands of unstructured documents daily—PDFs, Word files, scanned images, emails. Manual sorting and routing is: Slow & Costly, Error-Prone, Unscalable. Goal: Build an AI-powered MAS that automatically ingests, extracts, classifies, and routes documents at scale—reducing manual work, cutting errors, and providing full visibility on processing status."

Each agent reasons over its inputs, may leverage Generative AI/LLMs for hard NLP tasks, and emits structured events. A central Message Bus connects them; stateful agents track progress per document."
