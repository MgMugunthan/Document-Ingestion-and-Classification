**Document Ingestion & Classification**

**Problem Statement**

Enterprises face challenges with manual document sorting and routing due to:

* Slow & Costly processes (human bottleneck)
* Error-Prone (mis-tagged documents)
* Unscalability (overwhelmed workflows)

**Goal:** Develop an AI-powered system for automated ingestion, extraction, classification, and routing of documents to reduce manual work, errors, and improve visibility.


**Solution Overview**

A four-agent pipeline using an open-source agentic framework:

* **Ingestor Agent:**  Prioritizes documents based on sender, size, or folder; optionally summarizes email bodies.
* **Extractor Agent:** Uses OCR/NLP for text extraction and LLM prompts for entity extraction (dates, parties, amounts).
* **Classifier Agent:** Uses a fine-tuned classifier (or LLM) for document type tagging; flags low-confidence documents.
* **Router Agent:** Maps document types to target systems (e.g., invoice to accounting ERP); handles system failures.


**Web UI Design**

* **Operator Dashboard:**
    * Upload/Ingestion Panel (drag-and-drop or mailbox connection)
    * Workflow Progress Bar (Ingested, Extracted, Classified, Routed stages with timestamps and details)
    * Document List & Status (Name, Type, Status, Last Updated)
    * Manual Overrides (Re-extract, Re-classify, Route toâ€¦)
