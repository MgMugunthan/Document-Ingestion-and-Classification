Document Ingestion & Classification
Problem Statement
Enterprises generate hundreds of thousands of unstructured documents daily—PDFs,
Word files, scanned images, emails. Manual sorting and routing is:
• Slow & Costly: Human reviewers become a bottleneck.
• Error-Prone: Mis-tagged contracts slip through compliance gaps.
• Unscalable: Growing volume overwhelms static workflows.
Goal: Build an AI-powered MAS that automatically ingests, extracts, classifies, and routes
documents at scale—reducing manual work, cutting errors, and providing full visibility on
processing status.
2. Solution Overview
We decompose the pipeline into four collaborating agents on the opensource agentic
framework. Each agent reasons over its inputs, may leverage Generative AI/LLMs for hard
NLP tasks, and emits structured events. A central Message Bus connects them; stateful
agents track progress per document. Here we are give example agents and its reasoning.
Agent Inputs Outputs Reasoning / Generative AI Use
Ingestor File-share events, Raw document payload + • Reasoning: Decide priority based on
Agent email hooks, upload metadata event sender, file size, or folder.
API calls (doc.received) • LLM-Optional: Summarize email
bodies to extract subject/context.
Extractor doc.received event; Text + structured entities • OCR/NLP: Use OCR engines → LLM
Agent document binary (doc.text, doc.entities) to clean up noisy text.
• Entity Extraction: LLM prompts to
pull dates, parties, amounts.
Classifier Extracted text & Document type label + • Model Inference: Fine-tuned
Agent entities confidence (doc.type, classifier (or LLM zero-shot) to tag
score) invoice/contract/etc.
• Reasoning: If low confidence, flag
for human review.
Router Classified document Delivery commands (ERP • Routing Logic: Map types → systems
Agent event (doc.type) API call, DMS upload, (e.g. invoice → accounting ERP).
email alert) • Fallback Reasoning: If target
system down, enqueue retry or send

3. Web UI Design
A webUI gives both operators and admins live visibility into every document’s journey:
3.1 Operator Dashboard
1. Upload/Ingestion Panel
o Drag-and-drop or “Connect Mailbox” button.
2. Workflow Progress Bar
o Nodes:
1. Ingested
2. Extracted
3. Classified
4. Routed
o Each lights up with timestamp as agents complete their steps.
o Hover reveals details (e.g. “OCR took 3.2s,” “Type=Contract (94%
confidence)”).
3. Document List & Status
o Table of recent docs with columns: Name, Type, Status, Last Updated.
o Click row to expand the live progress bar and metadata panel.
4. Manual Overrides
Buttons to “Re-extract,” “Re-classify,” or “Route to…” if human intervention is needed
