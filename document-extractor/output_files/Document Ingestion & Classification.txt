### Document Ingestion & Classification

#### Problem Statement
Enterprises generate hundreds of thousands of unstructured documents daily—PDFs, Word files, scanned images, emails. Manual sorting and routing is:
- **Slow & Costly:** Human reviewers become a bottleneck.
- **Error-Prone:** Mis-tagged contracts slip through compliance gaps.
- **Unscalable:** Growing volume overwhelms static workflows.

**Goal:** Build an AI-powered MAS that automatically ingests, extracts, classifies, and routes documents at scale—reducing manual work, cutting errors, and providing full visibility on processing status.

### Solution Overview
We decompose the pipeline into four collaborating agents on the open-source agentic framework. Each agent reasons over its inputs, may leverage Generative AI/LLMs for hard NLP tasks, and emits structured events. A central Message Bus connects them; stateful agents track progress per document. Here are example agents and their reasoning:

| **Agent**       | **Inputs**                          | **Outputs**                                     | **Reasoning / Generative AI Use**                                                                                       |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Ingestor**    | File-share events, Raw document payload, email hooks, upload metadata, API calls (doc.received) | • doc.received event                          | • Reasoning: Decide priority based on event sender, file size, or folder.                                               |
|                 |                                     |                                                 | • LLM-Optional: Summarize email bodies to extract subject/context.                                                     |
| **Extractor**   | doc.received event, Document binary | Text + structured entities (doc.text, doc.entities) | • OCR/NLP: Use OCR engines → LLM to clean up noisy text.                                                                |
|                 |                                     |                                                 | • Entity Extraction: LLM prompts to pull dates, parties, amounts.                                                      |
| **Classifier**  | Extracted text & entities           | Document type label + confidence (doc.type, score) | • Model Inference: Fine-tuned classifier (or LLM zero-shot) to tag invoice/contract/etc.                               |
|                 |                                     |                                                 | • Reasoning: If low confidence, flag for human review.                                                                 |
| **Router**      | Classified document event (doc.type) | Delivery commands (ERP API call, DMS upload, email alert) | • Routing Logic: Map types → systems (e.g., invoice → accounting ERP).                                                 |
|                 |                                     |                                                 | • Fallback Reasoning: If target system down, enqueue retry or send Slack alert.                                       |

### Web UI Design
A web UI gives both operators and admins live visibility into every document’s journey:

#### Operator Dashboard
1. **Upload/Ingestion Panel**
   - Drag-and-drop or “Connect Mailbox” button.

2. **Workflow Progress Bar**
   - Nodes:
     1. Ingested
     2. Extracted
     3. Classified
     4. Routed
   - Each lights up with timestamp as agents complete their steps.
   - Hover reveals details (e.g., “OCR took 3.2s,” “Type=Contract (94% confidence)”).

3. **Document List & Status**
   - Table of recent docs with columns: Name, Type, Status, Last Updated.
   - Click row to expand the live progress bar and metadata panel.

4. **Manual Overrides**
   - Buttons to “Re-extract,” “Re-classify,” or “Route to…” if human intervention is needed.
